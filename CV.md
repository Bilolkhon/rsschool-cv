## –êbout Me

Recently I have come to a thought that I need to get out of my routine life and change it 180 degrees. Start all over again with something unfamiliar and interesting to me. Hence, my choice was IT and coding. This is a huge new world that gets bigger and bigger over the years. I want to study it as much as possible, I want to create, live and enjoy in this area every day. Another reason why IT and coding is because I have been very fond of the worlds of computer technology since childhood and very quickly mastered everything new associated with them.

## Skills

Although I am not fluent in using programming languages and other tools for writing code, I have a basic understanding of the field and try to replenish my knowledge and learn new things every day.

## Code examples

Hopefully there will be many good examples here soon. :)

## Experience

Since I am from another field of activity, I have no experience in programming. I have just started my studies and am currently studying HTML and JavaScript at RS School.

## Education
