         <p class="feature-text">
            Recently I have come to a thought that I need to get out of my routine life and change it 180 degrees. 
            Start all over again with something unfamiliar and interesting to me. Hence, my choice was IT and coding. 
            This is a huge new world that gets bigger and bigger over the years. I want to study it as much as possible, 
            I want to create, live and enjoy in this area every day. Another reason why IT and coding is because 
            I have been very fond of the worlds of computer technology since childhood and very quickly mastered everything 
            new associated with them.
